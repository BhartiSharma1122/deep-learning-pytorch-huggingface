    "In this tutorial, we are going to fine-tune the new [GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B) on the [ELI5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5) dataset to improve the explanation and question-answering skills of the agent. The [ELI5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5) dataset is an English-language dataset of questions and answers gathered from three subreddits where users ask factual questions requiring paragraph-length or longer answers. We are going to use Hugging Face Transformers and DeepSpeed ZeRO to fine-tune our model.\n",
